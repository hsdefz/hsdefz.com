      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Tea is a drink made 
        by infusing leaves of the tea plant (<em>Camellia sinensis</em>, or <em>Thea 
        sinensis</em>) in hot water. The name 'tea' is also used to refer to the 
        leaves themselves; and it is also the name of a mid- to late-afternoon 
        meal in the British Isles and associated countries, at which tea (the 
        drink) is served along with various foods. </font>

      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The three main categories 
        are green, black, and oolong. All three kinds are made from the same plant 
        species. The major differences between them are a result of the different 
        processing methods they undergo. Black teas undergo several hours of oxidation 
        in their preparation for market; oolongs receive less oxidation, and green 
        teas are not oxidized at all. </font>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">There are, of course, 
        many different varieties within these three main categories. </font>

            href="http://www.tea.com/pages/faq/#backto1.2.2.">1.2.2. What about 
        herbal teas?</a></strong> </font>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Hundreds of different 
        herbs have been used in beverages. These are sometimes called herbal teas. 
        Tea professionals and connoisseurs usually prefer to restrict the name 
        'tea' to real tea, so you may see the following names used as well: A) 
        'Herbal infusion', which simply means a drink made by steeping an herb 
        in hot water. (Tea itself is an infusion of tea leaves.) B) 'Tisane' [pronounced 
        tee-ZAHN], which in French means any herbal drink. </font>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Some common herbs 
        that are used as tisanes are peppermint, chamomile, rose hips, lemon verbena, 
        and fennel. A number of companies specialize in producing herbal blends. 
        Many tea companies also sell tisanes. </font>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Some exaggerated claims 
        have been made for the medicinal properties of herbal infusions. Even 
        so, some herbs do have generally recognized benefits. For instance, rose 
        hips contain vitamin C; chamomile helps many people relax; and peppermint 
        has a noticeable soothing effect on the stomach. Herbs can also cause 
        problems. Chamomile, for example, can cause allergic reactions in people 
        who are allergic to ragweed. </font>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong><a name=1.3. 
            href="http://www.tea.com/pages/faq/#backto1.3.">1.3. Where does tea 
        come from?</a></strong> </font>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Tea has been an item 
        of trade and tribute for at least three thousand years. It was first cultivated 
        and brewed in China, and many of the best varieties still come from China. 
        Some of the finest oolongs in the world are grown in Taiwan. Japan also 
        produces a considerable amount of green tea, most of which is consumed 
        domestically. </font>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">After the British 
        took up tea drinking, they began cultivating the plants native to India 
        in order to have more control over the trade. India, Sri Lanka, and other 
        South Asian countries produce a large portion of the world harvest. </font>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong><a name=1.3.1. 
            href="http://www.tea.com/pages/faq/#backto1.3.1.">1.3.1. Is any tea 
        grown commercially in other regions?</a></strong> </font>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Indonesia (primarily 
        in Java and Sumatra) produces a considerable harvest each year, most of 
        which is exported for use in blends. </font>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Tea is also grown 
        commercially in Russia, Africa (notably Kenya), and South America. Some 
        of it is noteworthy, but not much. In addition to good genetic "parentage," 
        the right growing conditions are crucial. The best tea, with few exceptions, 
        is produced in warm, mountainous regions. There are not many such areas 
        outside Asia that have been given over to tea production. </font>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong><a name=1.3.2. 
            href="http://www.tea.com/pages/faq/#backto1.3.2.">1.3.2. Where did 
        the name 'tea' come from?</a></strong> </font>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The word for tea in 
        most of mainland China (and also in Japan) is 'cha'. (Hence its frequency 
        in names of Japanese teas: Sencha, Hojicha, etc.) But the word for tea 
        in Fujian province is 'te' (prounounced approximately 'tay'). As luck 
        would have it, the first mass marketers of tea in the West were the Dutch, 
        whose contacts were in Fujian. They adopted this name, and handed it on 
        to most other European countries. The two exceptions are Russia and Portugal, 
        who had independent trade links to China. The Portuguese call it 'cha', 
        the Russians 'chai'. Other areas (such as Turkey, South Asia and the Arab 
        countries) have some version of 'chai' or 'shai'. </font>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">'Tay' was the pronunciation 
        when the word first entered English, and it still is in Scotland and Ireland. 
        For unknown reasons, at some time in the early eighteenth century the 
        English changed their pronunciation to 'tee'. Virtually every other European 
        language, however, retains the original pronunciation of 'tay'. </font>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong><a name=1.4. 
            href="http://www.tea.com/pages/faq/#backto1.4.">1.4. How is tea produced?</a></strong> 
        </font>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The first step in 
        tea production is the harvest. Most harvesting is still done by hand, 
        which (as you can imagine) is very labor-intensive. Some growers have 
        had success using a machine that acts much like a vacuum cleaner, sucking 
        the leaves off the branch. The latter method is used for the cheaper varieties 
        of tea, as it is not capable of discriminating between the high-quality 
        tip leaves and the coarser leaves toward the bottom of the branch. </font>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The harvested leaves 
        can be processed in two ways: CTC or orthodox. </font>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">CTC, which stands 
        for "crush, tear, curl," is used primarily for lower-quality leaves. CTC 
        processing is done by machine; its name is actually fairly descriptive. 
        The machines rapidly compress withered tea leaves, forcing out most of 
        their sap; they then tear the leaves and curl them tightly into balls 
        that look something like instant coffee crystals. The leaves are then 
        "fired," or dehydrated. </font>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Most tea connoisseurs 
        are not very interested in CTC tea, since this process does not allow 
        for the careful treatment that high-quality leaves merit. But CTC has 
        an important and legitimate role in the tea industry: since it is a mechanized 
        process, it allows for the rapid processing of a high volume of leaves 
        which otherwise would go to waste. It is also good for producing a strong, 
        robust flavor from leaves of middling quality; in fact, for many varieties 
        of leaf CTC is the preferred processing method. </font>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The orthodox method 
        is a bit more complex, and is usually done mostly by hand. The process 
        differs for black, green, and oolong teas. The basic steps in the production 
        of black tea are withering, rolling, oxidation, and firing. </font>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">First, the leaves 
        are spread out in the open (preferably in the shade) until they wither 
        and become limp. This is so that they can be rolled without breaking. 
        </font>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Rolling is the next 
        step. This is rarely done by hand any more; it is more often done by machine. 
        Rolling helps mix together a variety of chemicals found naturally within 
        the leaves, enhancing oxidation. After rolling, the clumped leaves are 
        broken up and set to oxidize. </font>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Oxidation, which starts 
        during rolling, is allowed to proceed for an amount of time that depends 
        on the variety of leaf. Longer oxidation usually produces a less flavorful 
        but more pungent tea. </font>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Finally, the leaves 
        are heated, or "fired," to end the oxidation process and dehydrate them 
        so that they can be stored. </font>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Oolong is produced 
        just like black tea, except that the leaves are oxidized for less time. 
        </font>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Green tea is not oxidized 
        at all. Some varieties are not even withered, but are simply harvested, 
        fired, and shipped out. </font>

        graded?</a></strong> </font>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The first thing to 
        keep in mind is that these are descriptions of the dry, cured leaf <em>only</em>. 
        They have no necessary relation to the aroma, color, or flavor of the 
        end product. It is possible to get a delicious cup from ugly, broken leaves; 
        it is possible to get an awful cup from well-handled, beautiful whole 
        leaves. But since you may have little information to work with other than 
        the grade, let's look at the various grades. </font>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">There are different 
        grading schemes for black and green teas. </font>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Here are the basic 
        grades of black tea:<br>
        Flowery Orange Pekoe (peck-oh), Orange Pekoe<br>
        Pekoe <br>
        Souchong<br>
        Broken Orange Pekoe<br>

        <br>
        'Pekoe' (pronounced 'PECK-oh') is derived from a Chinese word meaning 
        'white'; this referred to the white hair on the leaf bud. Early Western 
        merchants used the word to mean that the leaves so graded were exclusively 
        plucked from the tip of the branch: the leaf bud and the two leaves below 
        the bud. Its use in India and Sri Lanka broadened to mean whole leaves 
        of a uniform size, and this is what it generally means now. This may include

      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">'Orange' is variously 
        described as a reference to the Dutch House of Orange or as a reference

        than Pekoe leaves. </font>

      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Processed tea is sieved 
        to insure that leaves of uniform size are packaged together. Fannings 
        and dust are bits and pieces of tea leaves left over from the sievings 
        that separate out whole leaves and large pieces of leaf. Fannings are 
        slightly larger than dust. </font>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Loose tea is generally 
        whole leaves. Bagged tea is usually Broken Orange Pekoe and Broken Pekoe, 
        fannings, and dust. The broken grades are created by mechanized crushing 
        of the leaves. Broken leaves infuse more quickly, which is desirable in 
        a tea bag. But because of their larger surface area, broken leaves also 
        become stale more quickly. </font>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Since much of the 
        bagged tea sold in the US is marked "Orange Pekoe," many people think 
        that Orange Pekoe is a special kind of tea. But it is not. It is a grading 
        measurement that applies only to the size and physical condition of the 
        leaves, not their kind or quality. Most tea that is labeled "Orange Pekoe" 
        is blended black tea, typically from India and/or Sri Lanka. </font>

        under the impression that these abbreviations stood for "Too Good For 
        Ordinary People" and "Far Too Good For Ordinary People." Not a bad guess,

          a lighter color than fully formed leaves, hence 'golden'.) </font>
        <li><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>FTGFOP</strong>:

      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Occasionally, tea 
        connoisseurs will express contempt for tea bags, for the following reasons: 
        1. Most of the tea that goes into bags is not very high quality. As noted 
        above, tea bags usually contain broken grades so that they will infuse 
        quickly. 2. Whole-leaf teas come in a larger number of varieties; and 
        the most interesting and enjoyable teas are sometimes not available in 
        bags. 3. Bags are semi-non-biodegradable additions to the biodegradable 
        tea leaves. 4. Connoisseurs like to have something to sneer at. </font>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Seriously, though, 
        most tea drinkers use tea bags some of the time, simply because it may 
        not be convenient to brew loose leaves (at work, for example). Use what 
        works for you. </font>

            href="http://www.tea.com/pages/faq/#backto1.6.">1.6. Is fancy tea 
        much more expensive than standard commercial tea?</a></strong> </font>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Most good tea is not 
        very expensive; and it may be cheaper than you think. When you buy tea 
        in bags, most of what you pay for is the process of putting the teas in 
        the bags, and the brand name advertising. Fancy tea is generally sold 
        loose, and the price per cup is often lower than for commercial tea. </font>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Of course, as with 
        most things, you can spend a lot for tea if you try. But if price is a 
        concern, start small. Some truly fine teas retail in the United States 
        for less than US$20 per pound, which means less than 10 cents per cup. 
        (I'm told that tea prices outside the United States are roughly comparable.) 
        Unfortunately, high quality loose leaf tea is typically not available 
        in supermarkets; you will probably have to seek out a specialty shop or 
        a mail-order company. </font></UL>

        </font>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">First, a general guide; 
        details below. </font>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">A) Start with fresh, 
        cold water. Tap water is often acceptable; if your tap water has a noticeable 
        taste, you may want to use filtered or bottled water. Put the water in 
        a kettle to boil. </font>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">B) Prepare a teapot: 
        heat it by filling it (or rinsing it) with hot water. </font>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">C) Shortly before 
        the water in the kettle boils, empty out the teapot and add the tea leaves. 
        <br>
        You may want to put the leaves loose in the pot, or use a strainer, sock, 
        or tea ball. You can, of course, also use tea bags in a pot. If you do, 
        place the bags on the bottom of the pot so that they will be struck by 
        the boiling water as it falls on them. </font>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">D) Bring the teapot 
        to the kettle and add the water. For most black and oolong teas, add the 
        water just after it reaches a full boil. See below for more detailed information. 
        </font>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">E) Allow the tea to 
        infuse for three to five minutes. Be careful not to let the tea stand 
        for too long. Different teas take different infusion times. See below. 
        </font>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">F) During the infusion, 
        give the teapot a good shake or stir to let the leaves circulate. After 
        they settle, pour the tea. Some authorities recommend using cups that 
        have been pre-heated with hot water. This is primarily important if you 
        are using very thin porcelain that could be cracked by the sudden addition 
        of very hot tea. </font>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">G) Add whatever accessories 
        you prefer: milk, sugar, honey, lemon, etc. Cream is usually too heavy 
        and should be avoided. There is considerable debate about whether to put 
        milk in the cups before you add the tea or afterwards. See below. </font>

        tap water? Wouldn't hot tap water boil faster?</a></strong> </font>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Household water heaters 
        heat water for washing, not for drinking. Water out of the hot tap generally 
        has health-threatening levels of heavy metals (such as lead), as well 
        as an off taste. You should consider this water unfit for human consumption. 
        </font>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Incidentally, if you 
        live in the United States in a house whose plumbing system was constructed 
        between the 1930s and the late 1970s, it's a good idea to let the cold 
        tap run at full for about a minute before using it. This will help flush 
        out heavy metals that may have collected in the water as it sat in the 
        plumbing system. This goes for all tap water consumption, of course, not 
        just for tea. </font>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Some tea drinkers 
        start with filtered water, particularly in areas with unpleasant or unhealthy 
        tap water. Although this can improve the quality of the final product, 
        some filtration systems have an annoying disadvantage. Systems that filter 
        the water and then store it in a reservoir (such as the popular Brita 
        system) often yield flat, odd-tasting tea. This may be because these systems 
        produce de-oxygenated water. Some people recommend using filtered water 
        immediately after it has been filtered, or re-oxygenating the water by 
        pouring it vigorously between two glasses about five or six times. </font>

      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It's not absolutely 
        necessary, but it does keep the infusion from cooling off too quickly. 
        Tea experts believe that this helps preserve some of the more subtle components 
        of a fine cup of tea. Some people also like to place a tea cozy over the 
        pot while the tea infuses, for the same reason. Note that green and oolong 
        teas often benefit from slightly cooler water than black tea, so using 
        a cozy during infusion is not recommended for these varieties. </font>

      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">There are many different 
        kinds of teapots, all with their own particular good points and bad points. 
        Ceramic pots are traditional throughout most of Asia; most retain heat 
        well (depending on the thickness of the ceramic) and many are attractively 
        decorated. But, like all ceramics, they can chip and break. </font>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Thick glass pots have 
        all the advantages (and disadvantages) of ceramics, with the important 
        difference that you can watch the tea infuse. </font>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Some people like metal 
        pots. Their main disadvantage is that they conduct heat away from the 
        infusion more rapidly than do ceramics. Some are also rumored to give 
        an off taste to the drink. </font>

        tea bags, what's the difference?</a></strong> </font>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">High-quality tea is 
        usually sold as loose tea. In addition, tea in bags goes stale much more 
        quickly because of its greater surface area (and hence greater exposure 
        to atmospheric oxygen); and it tends to pick up odors and flavors from 
        surrounding foods (or, I'm told, from the box it's in). </font>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Still, bags can be 
        very convenient, especially if you are preparing tea away from home. It 
        may be a good idea to store bagged tea in a tightly closed metal or opaque 
        glass container to help keep it fresh longer. </font>

            href="http://www.tea.com/pages/faq/#backto2.2.5.">2.2.5. How much 
        tea should I use?</a></strong> </font>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">There is no real consensus 
        about this matter. A traditional bromide is that one should add "one teaspoon 
        for each person, plus one for the pot." But this does not specify how 
        much water each person gets, or exactly how big a teaspoon is. I have 
        seen recommendations ranging from one teaspoon per 5.5 ounces of water 
        to one teaspoon per 16 ounces of water -- and these also do not explain 
        how big a teaspoon is, or whether they mean level teaspoons or heaping 
        teaspoons. </font>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In fact, I doubt that 
        there is any reliable figure one can give. The amount of tea you should 
        use depends on many variables. If you plan to add milk and sugar to your 
        tea, you should probably add more leaves. If you are brewing fresh, high-quality 
        leaves, you can use fewer. Ultimately, I can only suggest that you experiment 
        and decide on the amount that suits you best. </font>

        tea balls, strainers, etc.</a></strong>? </font>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">There are many different 
        options for dealing with loose leaves. </font>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">A) Leaves loose in 
        the pot. Advantages: The leaves have maximum freedom to uncurl and circulate 
        in the water, which makes for stronger and more flavorful tea. Disadvantages: 
        You have to figure out some way to get the tea off the leaves once it 
        has infused. Also, you have to wash the leaves out of the pot. If you 
        use loose leaves and are brewing one cup, you can pour the tea through 
        a strainer, which will catch any leaves that escape the pot. If you are 
        brewing more than one cup, you can try any of the following:<br>
        --Warm two pots and pour the brewed tea into the second pot. You may want 
        to place a tea cozy over the pot to keep the remaining tea hot. <br>
        --Pour the brewed tea into a vacuum container. </font>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">B) The tea ball. Most 
        tea balls are made of aluminum with small holes for water circulation. 
        Advantage: Easy to remove and clean. Very few leaves escape. Disadvantages: 
        often, there is insufficient space for the leaves to expand. Also, the 
        water cannot circulate properly around the leaves. </font>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">C) The stainless-steel 
        mesh infuser. This is, as the name implies, made of stainless-steel mesh. 
        Advantages: better circulation than an aluminum ball. Easy to remove and 
        clean. Disadvantages: the leaves are still more restricted than they would 
        be loose. Infusers also come in plastic mesh and gold mesh. Some are sized 
        to fit into a teacup; some, to fit a pot. </font>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">D) The basket filter. 
        This is a metal, plastic, or ceramic basket to hold the leaves. (Some 
        teapots are specially constructed to hold a filter.) Advantages: easy 
        to remove and clean. The leaves can circulate almost as freely as if they 
        were loose. Disadvantages: Slight additional expense. Not all baskets 
        fit all teapots. Specially constructed teapots are expensive. </font>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">E) The tea sock. A 
        fabric enclosure for the leaves. Advantages: Easy to remove, fairly unrestrictive 
        of the expanding leaves. Disadvantages: Annoying to clean. It may retain 
        odors from previous batches. </font>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">F) The paper filter. 
        This is like a coffee filter and fits into a plastic holder. Advantages: 
        easy to remove and discard. Disadvantages: The paper is disposable, which 
        may have unwanted environmental consequences. </font>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">G) The plunger pot. 
        Similar to the melior pot used for brewing coffee, the plunger pushes 
        the leaves to the bottom of the pot and holds them there. Advantages: 
        completely free circulation of the leaves. Disadvantages: the leaves have 
        not actually been removed from the liquor, so they continue to infuse. 
        Also, you have to wash the leaves out of the pot just as with loose leaves.

        One can also brew tea in a coffee maker, in much the same way that one 
        brews coffee. A machine expressly designed to brew tea automatically has 
        also recently been introduced to the marketplace. The biggest worry most 
        tea drinkers have about these methods is that they heat the water somewhat 
        short of the boiling point. While this is a good way to brew coffee, it 
        is less than ideal for most kinds of tea. But it's also true that some 
        very discriminating tea drinkers have reported good results with tea brewing 
        machines. </font>

      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Most black and oolong 
        tea should be infused in water that has just achieved a vigorous boil. 
        You may want to place a tea cozy over the teapot during infusion in order 
        to avoid heat loss. </font>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Green teas, however, 
        are generally better suited to water that has cooled off slightly from 
        the boiling point. This holds especially if the tea is high-quality (e.g. 
        Japanese Gyokuro). The same is true for Baozhong, lightly oxidized oolong 
        such as Tung Ting, and first flush Darjeeling. In general, the closer 
        a tea is to green, the cooler the water should be. Experiment and see 
        how you prefer it. </font>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">If you are concerned 
        about overheating these sorts of delicate leaves, do not place a tea cozy 
        on the pot during the infusion, as it keeps too much heat in the pot. 
        (Using the cozy to keep tea warm after it has finished infusing is fine.) 
        Some authorities even suggest leaving the lid off the teapot when infusing 
        green tea, to let some heat escape. </font>

        is a tea cozy, anyway?</a></strong> </font>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">A tea cozy is a fabric 
        cover (similar to an oven mitt) which is placed over a teapot in order 
        to prevent heat loss. Cozies come in a variety of shapes and sizes. Most 
        are designed simply to cover the entire pot, handle and spout. Some, however, 
        are made with openings and elastic so that they cover only the body of 
        the teapot, leaving the handle and spout exposed so that you needn't remove 
        the cozy in order to pour the tea. </font>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">A cozy is primarily 
        useful if you make several cups at a time and want the excess tea to remain 
        hot in the pot until you're ready to drink it. Note that ceramic handles 
        tend to become very hot when the pot is kept warm in this fashion. If 
        you have never used a cozy, be careful! </font>

      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Pretty seriously. 
        If you've ever tasted oversteeped tea, you know that it is bitter and 
        astringent--an all-around nasty experience. There is probably a little 
        margin for error, but if you put the tea on to infuse and forget about 
        it for half an hour, start over again. </font>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Three to five minutes 
        is fine for most varieties. Oolong, which is always large leaves, can 
        benefit from a long steeping time such as four to six minutes. Darjeeling, 
        interestingly enough, is often best with a steeping time between 90 seconds 
        and three minutes. (Since it tends toward astringency, the short steeping 
        time helps keep the balance of flavors right. This is especially true 
        of first flush Darjeeling.) </font>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Some people like their 
        tea best when steeped for ten to fifteen minutes. This is often (but not 
        always) because they drink their tea with large amounts of milk and sugar 
        and want to make sure that they will also be able to taste the tea. If 
        you prefer to drink tea without additional flavorings, a two-to-four minute 
        infusion time will probably give you the best results. As always, you 
        should experiment to see what suits you best. </font>

      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">There is very little 
        common ground in this debate. Perhaps the only thing both camps agree 
        on is the historical fact that the earliest porcelain cups manufactured 
        in England were likely to crack if very hot tea was poured directly into 
        them. Placing the milk in the cup before adding the tea helped protect 
        the cup. (Modern porcelain, however, does not need a milk buffer.) There 
        is also some talk of "scalding" the milk, but some people say that milk-first 
        scalds the milk; others, that tea-first scalds the milk. There is also 
        disagreement about whether scalding the milk is good or bad; some say 
        it improves the flavor, others that it ruins the milk. </font>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Then there are those 
        of us who consider the whole dispute somewhat akin to Scholastic debates 
        about angels dancing on pinheads. One way to avoid the issue is to eschew 
        milk completely. Still, I must admit that some tea (especially long-steeped 
        English or Irish Breakfast) takes very well to a bit of milk. </font>

      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Iced tea is a staple 
        of American Southern life; it is very popular throughout much of the United 
        States, enough so that it is now being marketed in cans and bottles. </font>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Good iced tea uses 
        a decent brand of black tea which is then cooled (either in a refrigerator 
        or by being poured over ice). Some people add sugar; others would rather 
        drink muddy water than sugared iced tea. The sweetened vs. non-sweetened 
        divide is probably the American South's version of the milk-first vs. 
        tea-first rift among Brits. Some people also like to add lemon. </font>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Iced tea is very easy 
        to make. Infuse a strong concentrate of tea (i.e. much less water than 
        one would use for that amount of leaves) and add it to cold water to the 
        right proportions. The better the quality of the tea, the better the iced 
        tea will taste. It's probably a good idea to use a strong-tasting tea 
        that can stand up to the cold. Assam, for example, makes terrific iced 
        tea. </font>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">An alternative method 
        is to make sun tea: fill a large glass jar with water, put in tea bags 
        or leaves, cover it, and put it in direct sunlight for several hours. 
        When the tea is strong enough, pour over ice and serve. Although this 
        method is fairly popular, it may be somewhat risky, as it involves using 
        water that has not been boiled -- indeed, water that has been left out 
        in the sun to reach ideal bacterial-reproduction temperatures. I recommend 
        avoiding this sort of risk by always brewing tea with boiling or near-boiling 
        water. </font>

        <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Tea should be stored 
          in an airtight, opaque container in a cool, dry place. Many tea retailers 
          sell tea in metal tins that close tightly, which seems optimal. Clear 
          glass jars are acceptable only if you can keep them in a closed cupboard 
          away from light. If you reuse containers, avoid using materials that

        <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The refrigerator 
          is NOT a good place. The cold encourages water condensation, which can 
          ruin the tea. You can freeze tea for long-term storage if you tightly 
          seal your container and wrap it in plastic. Before you open a container 
          of frozen tea, let it warm to room temperature in order to avoid contaminating 
          the tea with condensation. (You may also want to do this on a dry day.)

        <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Even if you rinse 
          your pots and cups after every use, which is advisable, they will eventually 
          build up stains. Some people regard these stains as desirable, analogous 
          to seasoning a wok. This seasoning is certainly desirable (and unavoidable) 
          on unglazed equipment such as Yixing-style pots (see <strong><a 
            href="http://www.tea.com/pages/faq/#4.5.2.">4.5.2</a></strong>). Opinions 
          differ on whether it is desirable on china, porcelain, or glazed earthenware 
          pots. </font> 
        <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Those who do want 
          to remove tea stains face some minor complications. Most pots are not 
          dishwasher safe. In addition, many people would rather not use soap 
          or detergent on tea equipment, since they find that the drink picks 
          up an off flavor. (As with most things about tea, opinions differ on 
          this subject.) </font> 
        <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The simplest way 
          to rid yourself of stains without using soap is to brush the stains 
          off with a soft kitchen brush or toothbrush. Baking soda (sodium bicarbonate) 
          works surprisingly well as a cleaning agent. Just put some baking soda 
          on the wet brush and scrub. Really tough stains can be softened by putting 
          two teaspoons of baking soda into the pot and filling it with hot water. 
          Let sit for an hour, empty, brush, and rinse. </font>

          reported good results by using a drop of chlorine bleach in a potful 
          of water; but you must rinse the pot very carefully after this method!

        <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><em>Cha-no-yu</em>, 
          or "hot water for tea," is a ceremony of great antiquity and depth. 
          Like many of the ancient Japanese arts, it is viewed as a potential 
          means of Enlightenment; in other words, it is a central part of <em>chado</em>, 
          or the Way of Tea. It originated in China, where its practice eventually 
          died out; but combined with elements of Zen, it remains a fascinating 
          part of Japanese culture. </font> 
        <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">There are many different 
          versions of the Tea Ceremony, varying according to one's teacher and 
          his or her training. The features common to most versions are the following:<br>
          <br>
          A) The ceremony always involves a host and several guests (but only 
          a few). It can be held in a screened-off alcove of a main room, but 
          those who can afford it build a teahouse and garden. </font> 
        <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">B) The guests wait 
          in a special waiting room until summoned by the host. They walk through 
          the garden to the teahouse, which traditionally is elevated and has 
          a three-foot-tall door (so that guests must crawl to enter the building). 
          </font> 
        <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">C) The host ceremonially 
          decorates the teahouse with screens and a scroll or flowers. </font> 
        <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">D) Guests are served 
          a small meal including a sweet. </font> 
        <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">E) The host brings 
          in the tea utensils and begins preparing the tea. The water is boiled 
          and the tea bowl and whisk are heated. The powdered tea is placed in 
          a bowl and whisked to a thick consistency. After the guests drink the 
          bitter tea, the host cleans the utensils and the guests (more or less 
          ritually) examine and discuss the utensils. </font> 
        <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The tea ceremony 
          can last as long as four hours. The use of whisked powdered tea indicates 
          the antiquity of the ritual. This method of preparing tea dates from 
          the time of China's Sung dynasty, which lasted from the 900s to the 
          1200s. </font> 
        <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Some commentators 
          complain that the contemporary emphasis is often on ritual rather than 
          on aesthetic or spiritual experience. Others find the ceremony tedious 
          beyond description, and the tea ghastly and barely drinkable. At least 
          one author also claims that most current students of the tea ceremony 
          are more interested in matrimony than Enlightenment. </font> 
        <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">But impressions 
          differ. Other participants assert that if one approaches the ceremony

          method</a></strong> </font> 
        <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Japanese tea 
          ceremony is a metaphysical/religious ritual centered around tea. There 
          is nothing quite comparable in modern China (though, as noted above, 
          the Japanese ceremony originated in ancient China). </font> 
        <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Chinese do, 
          however, have a special method for brewing tea, which can produce remarkable 
          results. It is called the <em>gongfu</em> method. <em>Gongfu</em> means 
          something like "skill and care." It is the root of the term often used 
          for Chinese black teas, "Congou." (As "Kung Fu," it is also the term 
          often used in the West for Chinese martial arts, which are more properly 
          known as <em>Wu shu</em>. But I digress...) </font> 
        <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The <em>gongfu</em> 
          method is typically used for oolong and green teas. The best results 
          are with oolong. The typical method uses a very small teapot, preferably 
          a Yixing-style teapot, and small thimble-sized cups. If you do not have 
          a <em>gongfu</em> tea set, you can approximate the method with an ordinary 
          teapot, though the result may not be quite as good. </font> 
        <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Genuine Yixing teapots 
          are made of a sandy clay found near the town of Yixing in Jiangsu province. 
          Most of the teapots sold in the West with the label "Yixing" are not 
          actually made from Yixing clay; still, they seem to serve their purpose 
          well enough. Yixing-style teapots are made in a wide range of shapes, 
          and are not glazed. The porous interior of an unglazed pot is seasoned 
          by repeated infusions of tea leaves, and does not need to be cleaned. 
          </font> 
        <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The method is essentially 
          a series of brief infusions. The tiny pot is filled halfway (or more) 
          with leaves. The host fills the pot with boiling water and immediately 
          drains it to rinse the leaves. Then, the first infusion: the pot is 
          filled with boiling water and the leaves infuse for less than a minute. 
          (One source says "four to five slow breaths.") This infusion has the 
          strongest aroma. Some methods use two sets of cups: the tea is poured 
          into the first cup and then poured from that cup into the second cup. 
          One then smells the aroma left behind in the first cup, and drinks from 
          the second cup. </font> 
        <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The second infusion 
          lasts slightly longer than the first; it has a weaker aroma but more 
          flavor. Subsequent infusions take progressively longer; you may want 
          to add a slow breath to each infusion. Some teas can take four to five 
          infusions, or more. </font> 
        <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Since this method 
          requires a large amount of tea and several small cups (typically four), 
          it is best done for a group of oolong lovers. It can be a very convivial 
          occasion! </font>

          </font> 
        <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Caffeine is a stimulant 
          drug found in tea as well as in many other natural substances. Coffee 
          is better known as a dietary source of caffeine (and the source of the 
          name 'caffeine'), but tea contains a significant amount of the drug. 
          </font> 
        <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Other natural sources 
          of caffeine are chocolate and yerba maté, which is used as an herbal 
          drink in parts of South America. Caffeine is also added to many foods 
          and drugs, including soft drinks and pain relievers such as Excedrin.

          caffeine's effects on the body?</a></strong> </font> 
        <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Since it is a stimulant, 
          caffeine increases alertness and quickness of response, and often briefly 
          improves mood. It is a mild diuretic. In large doses, it can produce 
          jitters, anxiety, and insomnia. As with any stimulant, the period of 
          enhanced alertness and heightened mood is generally followed by a period 
          of depressed mood and ability. </font> 
        <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Caffeine is also 
          an addictive drug if taken regularly. Caffeine addiction is probably 
          the most common drug addiction in the world, with nicotine addiction 
          a close second. </font>

        <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Caffeine addiction 
          is not as serious as most drug addictions; it is certainly less serious 
          than nicotine addiction. It is also easier to shake than most other 
          addictions. </font> 
        <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Still, caffeine 
          addiction can be serious for some people. Since its effects are subtle 
          and socially accepted, caffeine addiction can be an unnoticed and difficult 
          to diagnose source of health problems. Probably the most common unwanted 
          side effect of addiction is the headache that marks the beginning of 
          withdrawal. (This headache is caused by the dilation of blood vessels 
          in the head that were constricted by the consumption of caffeine.) Other 
          symptoms of withdrawal, usually found in frequent and heavy users of 
          caffeine, are lethargy, irritability, and constipation. </font>

        <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Addiction to tea 
          is less common than addiction to coffee, because tea has less caffeine 
          than coffee. But if you drink enough tea on a regular basis, you can 
          become addicted. The most reliable sign that you are addicted to tea 
          is a recurring headache that seems to have no cause and can be relieved 
          by drinking tea or another caffeinated beverage (or by taking Excedrin, 
          which contains caffeine). </font> 
        <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">If you are worried 
          about addiction, the best thing to do is to cut down gradually on the 
          amount of caffeine you consume. If you also drink coffee and caffeinated 
          soft drinks or take medication containing caffeine, eliminating these 
          from your diet will make it easier for you to drink tea without fear 
          of serious addiction. </font>

          or less caffeine than black tea? </font> 
        <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The amount of caffeine 
          in a cup of tea varies tremendously, depending on the variety of tea 
          and the brewing time. There is a great deal of contention about the 
          caffeine content of various kinds of tea. Most people firmly hold the 
          opinion that green tea has less caffeine than black, but a professional 
          tea chemist has informed me that this is not true. Contrary to popular 
          belief, green tea is likely to have just as much caffeine as black; 
          and there is no reliable way of knowing in advance just how much caffeine 
          is in your cup. </font> 
        <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I can report that 
          the most caffeinated tea I have ever had was green. In 1995, I ordered 
          a small pot of Yin Hao jasmine at a local coffeehouse, unaware that 
          this delightful, high-quality delicacy was eye-popping, jaw-clenching 
          rocket fuel. After two small cups, my hands were trembling and I could 
          barely sit still. In fact, that same afternoon, I sat down and wrote 
          this entire document in twenty-five minutes. </font>

        <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The only way to 
          know for sure how much caffeine you are drinking is to have each individual 
          cup tested in a laboratory, which is not terribly practical if you intend 
          to drink it. My advice is to pay attention to the tea you drink and 
          judge it by how it makes you feel. There may be no better way to decide 
          how to regulate your intake. </font>

        <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Yes. Tea also contains 
          theobromine, which is chemically related to caffeine. Its effects on 
          the body are similar to those of caffeine (though a bit milder). </font>

          decaffeinated tea?</a></strong> </font> 
        <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">There are some brands 
          of decaffeinated tea on the market, but unfortunately their quality 
          is rarely very high. It is very difficult (perhaps impossible) to remove 
          caffeine from tea without degrading its quality. </font> 
        <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">On the other hand, 
          it is possible to prepare ordinary tea so as to remove most (not all) 
          of the caffeine from the finished product. Caffeine is very water-soluble, 
          more so than many of the flavor components in tea. So a very brief infusion 
          can remove much of the caffeine while preserving flavor. </font> 
        <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Here's how to do 
          it: boil enough water for twice as many cups as you intend to drink. 
          Pour the normal amount of water over the leaves, then infuse for twenty 
          to thirty seconds. Pour off the resulting brew and discard, keeping 
          the leaves. Bring the water to a boil again and pour it over the same 
          leaves, this time infusing for the normal three to five minutes. This 
          infusion is the one to drink. </font> 
        <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Incidentally, this 
          method can also be used to prepare a highly caffeinated drink without 
          many of the sedative components ordinarily found in the cup. In this 
          case, you drink the results of the twenty- to thirty-second infusion. 
          One of my philosophical colleagues swears by it, saying it's the only 
          source of caffeine that gives him a "clean burn." This method is, of 
          course, not much use to those of us who drink tea for the flavor. </font>

          you should try to quit. Breaking a caffeine addiction is, mercifully,

          offers the following advice for those who want to try to kick the habit 
          "cold turkey": </font> 
        <blockquote><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Do not 
          attempt it unless you have three days with no responsibilities and no 
          demands on your time and energy. Arrange for ways to keep yourself distracted 
          and comfortable. Prepare to be without energy and to have a headache 
          for forty-eight to seventy-two hours. Take nothing with caffeine.</font></blockquote>

        <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">If you are reluctant 
          to kick the habit all at once, you may want to try gradually easing

          Tea may be called weedy if it has a not-unpleasant vegetative aroma
